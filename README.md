# C++DataStructures
Some C++ templated data structures (some are iterable with custom iterator) that I did in the past during my coursework. Some things were done for fun such as using an AVL tree for chaining a Hash Table (overkill, a vector would be better in my case). Anyone is free to use this for reference or in your own code.
